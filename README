Scripts for Secret Society Wars (http://secretsocietywars.com/)

The main pieces:
ssw_report.py - Script to generate a daily report of the best trade and mining routes.

ssw_asteroids.txt - Expected asteroids for the current cycle. Read by ssw_report.py.
ssw_history.py - Writes out the history of SSW in human-readable form.
ssw_map_utils.py - Utilities to extract higher-level info from a parsed SSW sector map.
ssw_missing_links.py - This is essentially the structure of the maze in space for each cycle.
			It is used to fill in the blanks where the current map has unexplored
			(or forgotten) sectors.
ssw_probes.py - Script to facilitate updating the sector map when at degree 33.
			Reads a file containing known enemy sectors and figures out which unknown
			sectors are worth probing.
ssw_route.py - Script to find a route through an SSW sector map. This is particularly useful
			for visiting all your facilities.
ssw_sector_map2.py - Parser for a sector map HTML page from SSW. It also incorporates various
			knowledge about the rules for SSW maps, including how they've changed over time.
ssw_societies.py - Utilities to deal with SSW societies and alignments.
ssw_trade_routes.py - Script to find trade routes (and LuvSats) from an SSW sector map.

Other odds and ends:
parse_sector_map.py - A primitive map parser. This was actually written after SSW was reborn,
			but before I found the original scripts.
possible_primes.py - Script to help find those 3 pieces in prime-numbered sectors. Not needed
			now the quests have changed.
ssw_sector_map.py - Older version of ssw_sector_map.py.
ssw_track_movement.py - Script to figure out how things move over time. My conclusion was that
			it's all random, so this hasn't been used for a while.
